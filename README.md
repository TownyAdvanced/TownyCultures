# TownyCultures

## Introduction
- TownyCultures is an add-on plugin for Towny, which enables "cultures" on Towny servers.
- Players that share a culture have their own "chat" channel.
- Towns choose what culture they want to be a part of.

## Features
- Each town has a 'culture' e.g. "Greek", "Celtic", "Roman", "Azurian" etc.
- Each town culture is displayed on the Town screen.
- Town residents can communicate with all other town residents of the same culture (regardless of nation),
  <br>using the Culture Channel: `/cc <message>`.
- Town culture is fluid and dynamic. 
  There is no central administrator for each culture.
  <br>A new culture can be created by a mayor, using: `/town set culture <culture>`.
  <br>The same command can be used to join an existing culture.
- Nations do not create or specify culture in this way.
  <br>Instead their culture is the sum of whichever cultures their component towns identify with, 
  <br>and/or whichever culture(s) they might claim to be affiliated with.
- Culture is important in war systems where town transfer-after-invasion is possible,
  <br>because although a town might be transferred to an enemy nation,
  <br>the residents can continue communicating with their friends in the same culture,
  <br>using the Culture Channel: `/cc <message>`.
- Culture can be shown on your dynmap' town popups.
  <br>Add %culture% in your Dynmap-Towny config's InfoWindow.
- Culture can be shown using the placeholder: %townycultures_culture%
